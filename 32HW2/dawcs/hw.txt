The main difference between the two algorithms is that solving the maze using a stack processes the last item pushed onto the stack while with a queue, each new square to explore is added to the end of the queue. When you are searching with a stack, the search goes "deep" into the same direction until it hits a dead end. The last item pushed onto the stack is always right next to the current square being processed. When we solve the maze using a queue, the squares we explore expand outward like ripples in a pond. The squares closer to the starting square are explored before squares farther away.
